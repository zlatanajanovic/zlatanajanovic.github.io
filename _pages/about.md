Hello,

I am a roboticist researching AI methods for machine learning and reasoning to enable autonomous robots in the wild.

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Chair of Machine Learning and Reasoning at RWTH Aachen University with Prof. Hector Geffner. Earlier, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Cognitive Robotics Department (CoR) at Delft University of Technology (Netherlands) with Prof. Jens Kober. My background includes a PhD in Automation and Control from Graz University of Technology and an MSc from the University of Sarajevo. As a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow, I conducted research at VIRTUAL VEHICLE Research GmbH and held visiting roles at TU Delft, the University of Sarajevo, AVL List, and Volvo Cars.

For my work, I have received several best paper awards and the Hans List Award for my PhD thesis.

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
